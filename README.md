# Function comparison using Gaussian process (funGP)

## Description:
This repository contains the matlab code to implement funGP algorithm given 
in *Prakash, A., Tuo, R., & Ding, Y. (2020). "Gaussian process aided function comparison using noisy scattered data". arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.0789* available at this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07899).

## Usage:

- The main function file is `funGP.m`. The details about the input and the output of this function is given in the file.

- An example file is available (`example.m`) that applies the algorithm on a small sized problem. 

## Support for other languages:
An R implementation of the same algorithm can be found in `DSWE` package available on [`Github`](https://github.com/TAMU-AML/DSWE-Package).
