# Function comparison using Gaussian process (funGP)

## Description:
Matlab code implementing funGP algorithm given 
in *Prakash, A., Tuo, R., & Ding, Y. (2020). "Gaussian process aided function comparison using noisy scattered data". arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.0789* available at this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07899).

## Usage:

- The main function is called `funGP()`. The details about the input and output of this function is given in the matlab file `funGP.m`.

- An example script is available (`example.m`) that applies the algorithm to a small sized problem. 

## Support for other languages:
An `R` implementation of the same algorithm can be found in `DSWE` package available on [`Github`](https://github.com/TAMU-AML/DSWE-Package).
